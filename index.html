<a id="Susan" class="anchor" href="#Susan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Susan B. Anthony</h3>

<p>
From a very early age, she devoted her life to combating social issues
She was originally inspired to fight for women's rights in 1853 while she was campaigning against alcohol. Anthony was denied a chance to speak at a temperance convention because she was a woman. Seeing how unjust and unfair this was she decided it was time to fight back .
In 1869, Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton founded the National Woman Suffrage Association to help the fight to gain equality.
In her efforts, she essentially became the face of the movement and inspired others to join the fight.</p>

Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
