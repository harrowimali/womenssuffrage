<br>
<p>
Women's suffrage was the fight to gain the right to vote for women and to stand for electoral office. Limited voting rights were gained by women in Sweden, Finland and some western U.S. states in the late 19th century- however, America made no progress in equality of genders.
Women did not have the all same rights as men- they were treated like second class citizens.
Change was demanded!
This lasted from 1840 to 1920.

<p>From a very early age, she devoted her life to combating social issues. She was originally inspired to fight for women's rights in 1853, while she was campaigning against alcohol. Anthony was denied a chance to speak at a temperance convention because she was a woman. Seeing how unjust and unfair this was she decided it was time to fight back.
In 1869, Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton founded the National Woman Suffrage Association to help the fight to gain equality.
In her efforts, she essentially became the face of the movement and inspired others to join the fight.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Carrie Chapman Catt
</h3>
<p>Founder of the League of Women Voters 
Leading suffragist- Catt began her works after speaking at a convention in Washington DC in 1890.
Her writing and speaking engagements gave her a high reputation as a well known suffragette.
In 1892, she was asked by Susan B. Anthony to address Congress on the proposed suffrage amendment. In 1900, she eventually succeeded Anthony as NAWSA president.
She helped organize the International Women’s Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) in 1902. 
After traveling around the world, she returned to the US after her trips abroad to preach women’s suffrage in 1915 and resumed her duties in the NAWSA
Under Catt's leadership. The NAWSA won the backing of the U.S. House and Senate, as well as state support for the amendment's ratification. 
In 1917, New York passed a state woman suffrage referendum, and by 1918, President Woodrow Wilson was finally converted to the cause. 
After women finally gained the right to vote in 1919, Catt stepped down as president, but continued the fight for suffrage and equality.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lucy Burns and Alice Paul</h3>
<p>Lucy and Alice were good friends and together 
they created the National Woman's Party (NWA).
The National Woman’s Party is the militant wing of the women’s suffrage movement that utilized picketing and public demonstrations to gain popular attention for the right of women to vote in the United States.
This played an extreme role in women's suffrage, without this it may have taken a lot longer to gain the 19th amendment!

Eventually he was a supporter of the women's suffrage amendment.

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Seneca Falls Convention
</h3>

<p> This was held in Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls, N.Y and was the
first women's right convention.
It was organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton,
two abolitionist who met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention.
No noteworthy change happened for a couple years after the event.
Change only began once people started to become more organized and actually spoke out against inequality instead of simply just discussing it.

</h3>

NAWSA - National American Woman Suffrage Association<br>
IWSA - International Woman’s Suffrage Association<br>
NWP - National Woman's Party
</p>
<a id="19th-amendment" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><h3>The 19th Amendment
</h3>

<p>In 1918 representative Rankin opens debate on the suffrage amendment in the house. The amendment is passed, but the amendment fails in the Senate.
In 1919 the Senate passes 19th amendment and it goes on to ratification.
The 19th amendment was ratified on August 26,1920 and women finally gained the right to vote!
